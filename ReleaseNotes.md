**Release Date: January 10, 2025**

---

 **Welcome to DevOps-Bot CLI Tool!**

We’re thrilled to announce the **first official release** of the **DevOps-Bot CLI Tool (dob)**! This release marks a significant milestone in our mission to simplify and automate DevOps workflows. Whether you're managing cloud infrastructure, automating tasks, or deploying applications, **dob** is here to make your life easier.

---

 **What’s New in Version 0.1?**

This release introduces a robust set of features designed to streamline your DevOps processes. Here’s what you can expect:

# **1. Version Display and Debug Mode**
- **Command:** `dob --version`
  - Get detailed version information, including the dob version, Python version, and OS details.
  
- **Command:** `dob --debug`
  - Enable debug mode for detailed error tracebacks, making troubleshooting a breeze.

# **2. Run Pipeline UI**
- **Command:** `dob run-ui`
  - Launch the **Pipeline UI** on your preferred port (default: 4102). Perfect for visualizing and managing your pipelines.
  - Example: `dob run-ui --port 8080` starts the UI on port 8080.

# **3. Generate Webhook Secret**
- **Command:** `dob generate-webhook-secret`
  - Securely generate a 64-character webhook secret and store it in `webhook_secret.json`. Your secrets are safe with us!

# **4. File Structure Initialization**
- **Command:** `dob brood --init`
  - Initialize the required file structure for your DevOps workflows. This command creates essential `.dob` files and a default configuration file (`pigeon.dob`) with templates for email, AWS SNS, Slack, and Twilio configurations.

# **5. Check Node Connectivity**
- **Command:** `dob check-nodes <identifier> -u <username>`
  - Quickly check if you can connect to a remote node via SSH.
  - Example: `dob check-nodes node123 -u admin` tests connectivity to `node123` using the username `admin`.

# **6. AWS Configuration Management**
- **Command:** `dob aws config --ak <access_key> --sk <secret_key> --r <region>`
  - Easily configure AWS credentials for the dob tool.
  - Example: `dob aws config --ak ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOP --sk 123456789@abcdefghij --r us-west-2` stores your AWS credentials securely.

# **7. Configure SSH Access**
- **Command:** `dob aws configure-ssh -i <ip_address> -u <username> <ssh_key_path> -id <identifier>`
  - Configure SSH access on remote instances with ease. This command enables password and public key authentication and saves the host entry for future use.
  - Example: `dob aws configure-ssh -i 192.168.1.100 -u ubuntu ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub -id my-node` sets up SSH access for the user `ubuntu` on the instance with IP `192.168.1.100`.

---

 **Key Improvements**

- **Robust Error Handling:** We’ve built comprehensive error handling into the tool. Errors are displayed with user-friendly messages, and in debug mode, you’ll get detailed tracebacks for advanced troubleshooting.
- **Secure Credential Storage:** Your AWS credentials and webhook secrets are stored securely with restricted file permissions, ensuring unauthorized access is prevented.

---

 **Known Issues**

We’re committed to transparency, and while we’ve worked hard to make this release as stable as possible, there are a few known issues:

- **Pipeline UI Dependency:** The `run-ui` command depends on the Flask framework and the correct structure of UI files. Make sure Flask is installed and `app.py` is present in the `ui` directory.
- **SSH Configuration Limitations:** The `configure-ssh` command assumes a standard Linux environment with `systemctl` support. If you’re using a non-standard distribution, you may need to make manual adjustments.

---

 **Enhanced Build and Deployment Process**

We’ve supercharged the build and deployment process! Now you can trigger complex builds directly from the command line using a YAML configuration file. This feature provides flexibility for both local and remote environments.

# **Key Options:**
- `--file-path`: Specify the local path to the YAML configuration file.
- `--environment / -e`: Define the environment (e.g., dev, test, prod) for the build.
- `--remote-config / --rc`: Fetch configurations from a remote URL.
- `--set / -s`: Override variables directly from the command line in the format `key=value`.

# **Core Functionalities:**
1. **Local and Remote Configuration Support:** Fetch configurations from both local files and remote URLs.
2. **Environment-Specific Overrides:** Tailor builds for different stages (development, testing, production).
3. **Sensitive Variable Handling:** Securely handle sensitive variables with options to show or hide them during execution.
4. **Comprehensive Build Stages Execution:** Supports multiple build stages, including setup, testing, Maven/Gradle builds, Docker builds, and Kubernetes deployment.

 **Exciting New Features**

# **1. External Approval Workflow**
- **Function:** `request_external_approval`
  - Need approval before proceeding with critical tasks? This feature lets you request approval via email, ensuring you have the green light before moving forward.

# **2. Kubernetes Credential Setup**
- **Function:** `run_k8s_credential_setup`
  - Automate the creation of Kubernetes credentials, including ServiceAccounts, Roles, RoleBindings, and Secrets. Kubernetes deployments just got easier!

# **3. File Transfer Support**
- **Function:** `transfer_file`
  - Securely transfer files or directories to remote servers using SCP. Automation has never been this smooth.

# **4. Git Integration**
- **Function:** `commit_and_push_changes`
  - Automate your Git operations! Commit and push changes to remote repositories using SSH or Personal Access Token (PAT) authentication.

 **Dependency Management Enhancements**

- **OWASP Dependency-Check Integration:** Automatically detect vulnerabilities in your project dependencies.
- **SonarQube Analysis:** Perform static code analysis with configurable server URLs, project keys, and authentication tokens.

---

 **Additional Features**

- **SonarQube CLI Installation:** Automate the installation of the SonarQube CLI on remote servers.
- **Trivy Security Scanning:** Add support for automated vulnerability scanning using Trivy.
- **TestNG and JUnit Testing Automation:** Run TestNG and JUnit tests automatically on remote servers.
- **Rust/Cargo, Ruby/Bundler, and Go Modules Build Automation:** Build and test projects using Rust, Ruby, and Go with ease.

---

 **Performance Improvements**

- **Parallel Job Execution:** We’ve improved parallel job execution using Python’s `ThreadPoolExecutor`, making your builds faster and more efficient.
- **Real-Time Output Handling:** Get real-time feedback during task execution, so you always know what’s happening.

---

 **What’s Next?**

We’re already working on the next set of features and improvements, including:

- **Parallel Deletion:** Speed up resource cleanup with parallel deletion for independent resources.
- **Retry Mechanisms:** Automatically retry failed operations with exponential backoff for transient AWS API errors.
- **State Backup:** Introduce a state backup feature to allow safe restoration or retries in case of failure.
